Let us assume i have permutation of n natural numbers with size n

X = 1 2 3 4 5

Let i have its permiutation as Y = 5 1 3 2 4

For question details refer to : https://www.codechef.com/OCT15/problems/PERSHFTS

Now basic summary is that i need to say rank of permutation Y if that can be generated by shifting elements to the right
in bunches of size k. I have to answer queries along with the rank if it is YES.

Let any permutation is X and its nature is even ---->

1. If i shift elements in size " K " when " K " is even then i can generate every type of permutation from the permutation X
and my rank will be rank(X) as ususal

2. If K is odd then i can generate only those permutations which are also even. and rank will be (original rank)/2.
   For every permutation their exist N!/2 even and same number of odd permutations.
   
   Vice versa is the case when nature of X is odd.
