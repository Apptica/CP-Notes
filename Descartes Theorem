Suppose you have three mutually tangent circles and each circle has its curvature as a,b and c then the curvature of new circle which will be mutually tangent i.e. kissing these three circles will follow the following relationship --- 

d1 = a + b + c + root(a*b + b*c + c*a)
d2 = a + b + c - root(a*b + b*c + c*a)

one of the d represents the circle circumscribing the three and one between the three
negative d is the circumscribing circle
